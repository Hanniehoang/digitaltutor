and Principles\n","\n","**C**hemical engineering has to do with industrial processes in which raw materials are changed or separated into useful products. The chemical engineer must develop, design, and engineer both the complete process and the equipment used; choose the proper raw materials; operate the plants efficiently, safely, and economically; and see to it that products meet the requirements set by the customers. Chemical engineering is both an art and a science. Whenever science helps the engineer to solve a problem, science should be used. When, as is usually the case, science does not give a complete answer, it is necessary to use experience and judgment. The professional stature of an engineer depends on skill in utilizing all sources of information to reach practical solutions to processing problems.\n","\n","The variety of processes and industries that call for the services of chemical engineers is enormous. In the past, the areas of most concern to chemical engineers were ore beneficiation, petroleum refining, and the manufacture of heavy chemicals and organics such as sulfuric acid, methyl alcohol, and polyethylene. Today items such as polymeric lithographic supports for the electronics industry, high-strength composite materials, genetically modified biochemical agents in areas of food processing, and drug manufacture and drug delivery have become increasingly important. The processes described in standard treatises on chemical technology and the process and biochemical industries give a good idea of the field of chemical engineering.11\n","\n","Footnote 11: [https://www.nist.gov/](https://www.nist.gov/)\n","\n","Because of the variety and complexity of modern processes, it is not practicable to cover the entire subject matter of chemical engineering under a single head. The field is divided into convenient, but arbitrary, sectors. This text covers that portion of chemical engineering known as the unit operations.\n","\n","\n","## Unit Operations\n","\n","An economical method of organizing much of the subject matter of chemical engineering is based on two facts: (1) Although the number of individual processes is great, each one can be broken down into a series of steps, called operations, each of which in turn appears in process after process; (2) the individual operations have common techniques and are based on the same scientific principles. For example, in most processes solids and fluids must be moved; heat or other forms of energy must be transferred from one substance to another; and tasks such as drying, size reduction, distillation, and evaporation must be performed. The unit operation concept is this: By studying systematically these operations themselves--operations that clearly cross industry and process lines--the treatment of all processes is unified and simplified.\n","\n","The strictly chemical aspects of processing are studied in a companion area of chemical engineering called reaction kinetics. The unit operations are largely used to conduct the primarily physical steps of preparing the reactants, separating and purifying the products, recycling unconverted reactants, and controlling the energy transfer into or out of the chemical reactor.\n","\n","The unit operations are as applicable to many physical processes as to chemical ones. For example, the process used to manufacture common salt consists of the following sequence of unit operations: transportation of solids and liquids, transfer of heat, evaporation, crystallization, drying, and screening. No chemical reaction appears in these steps. On the other hand, the cracking of petroleum, with or without the aid of a catalyst, is a typical chemical reaction conducted on an enormous scale. Here the unit operations--transportation of fluids and solids, distillation, and various mechanical separations--are vital, and the cracking reaction could not be utilized without them. The chemical steps themselves are conducted by controlling the flow of material and energy to and from the reaction zone.\n","\n","Because the unit operations are a branch of engineering, they are based on both science and experience. Theory and practice must combine to yield designs for equipment that can be fabricated, assembled, operated, and maintained. A balanced discussion of each operation requires that theory and equipment be considered together. This book presents such a balanced treatment.\n","\n","**Scientific foundations of unit operations**\n","\n","A number of scientific principles and techniques are basic to the treatment of the unit operations. Some are elementary physical and chemical laws such as the conservation of mass and energy, physical equilibria, kinetics, and certain properties of matter. Their general use is described in the remainder of this chapter. Other special techniques important in chemical engineering are considered at the proper places in the text.\n","\n","## Unit Systems\n","\n","The official international system of units is SI (Systeme International d'Unites). Strong efforts are underway for its universal adoption as the exclusive system forall engineering and science, but older systems, particularly the centimeter-gram-second (cgs) and foot-pound-second (fps) engineering gravitational systems, are still in use and probably will be around for some time. The chemical engineer finds many physiochemical data given in cgs units; that many calculations are most conveniently done in fps units; and that SI units are increasingly encountered in science and engineering. Thus it becomes necessary to be expert in the use of all three systems.\n","\n","In the following treatment, SI is discussed first, and then the other systems are derived from it. The procedure reverses the historical order, as the SI units evolved from the cgs system. Because of the growing importance of SI, it should logically be given a preference. If, in time, the other systems are phased out, they can be ignored and SI used exclusively.\n","\n","### Physical Quantities\n","\n","Any physical quantity consists of two parts: a unit, which tells what the quantity is and gives the standard by which it is measured, and a number, which tells how many units are needed to make up the quantity. For example, the statement that the distance between two points is 3 m means all this: A definite length has been measured; to measure it, a standard length, called the meter, has been chosen as a unit; and three 1-m units, laid end to end, are needed to cover the distance. If an integral number of units are either too few or too many to cover a given distance, submultiples, which are fractions of the unit, are defined by dividing the unit into fractions, so that a measurement can be made to any degree of precision in terms of the fractional units. No physical quantity is defined until both the number and the unit are given.\n","\n","### SI Units\n","\n","The SI system covers the entire field of science and engineering, including electromagnetics and illumination. For the purposes of this book, a subset of the SI units covering chemistry, gravity, mechanics, and thermodynamics is sufficient. The units are derivable from (1) four proportionalities of chemistry and physics; (2) arbitrary standards for mass, length, time, temperature, and the mole; and (3) arbitrary choices for the numerical values of two proportionality constants.\n","\n","#### Basic equations\n","\n","The basic proportionalities, each written as an equation with its own proportionality factor, are\n","\n","\\[F =k_{1}\\frac{d}{dt}(mu)\\] (1.1) \\[F =k_{2}\\frac{m_{a}m_{b}}{r^{2}}\\] (1.2) \\[Q_{c} =k_{3}W_{c}\\] (1.3) \\[T =k_{4}\\lim_{p\\to 0}\\frac{pV}{m}\\] (1.4)

In practice, such extreme precision is seldom necessary, and defined\n","and experimental constants can be truncated to the number of digits appropriate to\n","the problem at hand, although the advent of the digital computers make it possible\n","to retain maximum precision at small cost.

These equations are\n","called dimensionless equations.\n","\n","A dimensionally homogeneous equation can be used as it stands with any set of\n","units provided that the same units for the five base units are used throughout. Units\n","meeting this requirement are called consistent units.
